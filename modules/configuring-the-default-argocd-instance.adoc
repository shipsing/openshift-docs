= Configuring the default Argo CD instance

Though the Operator creates a default Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, you must configure it to make it useful for deploying applications and setting cluster configuration.. The configurations include:

* RBAC: Argo CD uses its own RBAC configuration and the default permissions configured by the Operator may not be sufficient, depending on the {OCP} cluster groups your user has been assigned to.
* Permissions: The Operator configures the default instance with a default set of Kubernetes permissions. However, these permissions are insufficient when deploying applications in the real-time environment. So, ensure to provide additional privileges/permissions to this default instance.
