= Analyzing the default Argo CD instance details

After installation, you can use the OCP web console to view the default Argo CD instance details and its configuration. In its YAML configuration, analyze different configuration details of the server, controller, and rbac, to customize the behavior of the instance. This default instance is intended for the cluster configuration use case and has elevated privileges. However, you can create additional Argo CD instances in other namespaces to support application use cases.
