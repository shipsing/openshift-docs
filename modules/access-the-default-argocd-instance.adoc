= Access the default Argo CD instance

You can access the default instance through the Argo CD user interface.
 

.Prerequisite

* You have your login credentials to access the {OCP} cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.


.Procedure

. Click the Application Launcher menu (the waffle icon) in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Console.
. Select the Cluster Argo CD menu item. This will take you to the Argo CD user interface.
. Click the Log in via OpenShift button, which will bring you back to the OpenShift login screen.
. Enter your {OCP} credentials, and you will be brought back to the Argo CD UI.

At this point, the user interface is empty as no Argo CD Applications have been defined. You will rectify this after performing some basic configuration of Argo CD.
