With {gitops-title}, you can manage your {OCP} cluster configuration to have the following benefits:

* Version control and auditability: Configuration changes committed to Git provides a complete history of modifications. This facilitates auditing, compliance, and accountability.
* Single source of truth: Git serves as the definitive source for the desired state of your OCP cluster.
* Rollback and Disaster Recovery: Easy revert to a previous, known-good configuration by rolling back the Git repository, which reduces downtime and helps in disaster recovery.
* Collaboration and Review: Git's collaborative features enable team members to review and approve infrastructure and application configuration changes before they are applied to your OCP cluster.
* Efficiency and Scalability: OpenShift GitOps streamlines the deployment and operations workflows, enabling efficient management of complex and multi-cluster environments with reduced manual intervention and human error.
